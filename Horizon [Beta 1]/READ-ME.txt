Introduction:
=============

Welcome to the official Beta 1 version of Horizon, built in under 3 weeks, expected to release on September 20th.
This version is only compatible with computers.

About:
======

Horizon is a social media project that aims to deliver a secure user experience that doesn't share your data to third-parties, unlike Meta.
After seeing many user complaints concerning privacy & security measures on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook (Mark SuckerBerg), and so on, it
became our mission to make a new platform that will keep its promises to their clients (You).

Beta 1 features:
================

Dim/Dark Mode

Background Mode Memory (B.M.M; remembers whether you were initially on dim or dark mode before refreshing the page)

HorizonAI (built using Google's Gemini AI assistant for this version)


Troubleshoot:
=============

In file location "Javascript/scripts.js", line 18 -> if the API_KEY is missing, paste the following key: "AIzaSyC02ObF90pmqVSPnjFSw-FVSjBceJ5qOnM"

In file location "Javascript/scripts.js", line 32 -> if the API_URL is missing, paste the following URL: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`

If the AI doesn't respond back, here are a couple of solutions:

 1) Refresh your web page.
 2) If first solution doesn't work, view the web console (Right Click + Inpsect Source Code)
 3) *Following second solution, contact the developer.
